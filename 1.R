# Function fitter predict mean values of the response distribution 
#(i.e., the 'regression line') for a fitted model. 
#Can be performed for the data used to fit the model (posterior predictive checks) 
#or for new data. 
#By definition, these predictions have smaller variance than 
#the response predictions performed by the predict method.
#This is because the measurement error is not incorporated. 
#The estimated means of both methods should, however, be very similar.
